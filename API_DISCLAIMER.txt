API Disclaimer

In this example, we will be hard coding an API key into the applicationâ€™s source code. 
This is not something that is recommended for production systems and is being done only 
for simplicity within this example. In a production scenario, this call would be proxied 
through your own API/microservice in order to protect the API key from being visible to 
anyone using the client-side application.
